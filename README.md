# Assignment 1 : Basic Python Concepts

# Task 1 :- Basic Mathematical Operations

This program takes two numbers as input from the user and performs four basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It displays the results of each operation on the screen.

# Steps to solve task 1

- **Step 1 : Define the problem**  
  I needed to create a program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two user-provided numbers.
- **Step 2 : Plan the solution**  
  I decided to use simple arithmetic operators ( `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` ) and handle division by zero with a conditional expression.
- **Step 3 : Get user input**  
  I used `input()` to collect two numbers, converting them to `float` to support decimal values.
- **Step 4 : Perform calculations**  
  I calculated:
    - Addition : `num1 + num2`
    - Subtraction : `num1 - num2`
    - Multiplication : `num1 * num2`
    - Division : `num1 / num2`, with a check for `num2 != 0` to avoid errors.
- **Step 5: Display Results**  
  I used `print()` with f-strings to show each result clearly with including a message if division by zero is attempted.

# How to run this task
1. Open `task1.py` in a Python IDE.
2. Run the script and enter two numbers when prompted.

# Task 2 :- Greet the User with Full Name

This program takes the user first name and last name as input and combines them into a full name. In the last it prints a personalized greeting message.

# Steps to Solve Task 2

- **Step 1: Define the problem**  
  I needed to create a program that collects a userâ€™s first and last names and greets them with their full name.
- **Step 2: Plan the solution**  
  I decided to use string concatenation with a space between names and format a greeting message.
- **Step 3: Get user input**  
  I used `input()` to collect the first name and last name as strings.
- **Step 4: Combine both names**  
  I concatenated `first_name` and `last_name` with a space (`" "`) to form `full_name`.
- **Step 5: Display greeting**  
  I used `print()` with an f-string to output a welcome message including the full name.

# How to run this task
1. Open `task2.py` in a Python IDE.
2. Run the script and enter your first and last names when prompted.
